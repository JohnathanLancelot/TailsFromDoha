                    Bandit got her name when, shortly after we moved to Doha, she snuck into the house, leapt onto the kitchen counter and made off with a French bread longer than her own body, scaling the smooth concrete wall outside that was taller than I was, without dropping it!
                    I was pretty impressed. Cats in Doha are made of different stuff. They never turned their nose up at any kind of food, and poor Bandit was so desperate she was willing to steal bread to eat.
                </p>
                <p class="cat-info">
                    Unlike her sister, I wasn't able to tame Bandit enough - before my six months in Qatar were up - to get her to a vet, but I fed her and was able to rescue and find homes for her three kittens: Lotte, Teddy and Freckles. 
                    Bandit unfortunately gave birth among the gas bottles of a neighbour who did not like cats. They had called compound security to come and drown the newborns, and when I heard about this, I ran over with a towel and took them away back to my house.
                    Luckily, Bandit's sister Montessa had also just given birth, and so she readily accepted the three kittens and raised them as her own.
                </p>
                <p class="cat-info">
                    Separating Bandit from her kittens was not a decision that sat well with me, but unfortunately by nature it's common for mother cats to return their kittens to their original nesting spot even if you move them elsewhere, and I feared they would be reported again to security.
                    In addition, growing up with Montessa, who by then trusted humans and lived with me, meant that they were raised tame and therefore had a much better chance at finding forever homes.
